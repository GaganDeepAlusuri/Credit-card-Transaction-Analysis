## Introduction

The Credit Card Transactions Analysis project aims to gain insights into credit card spending patterns and customer behavior. This README provides an overview of the project, its purpose, methodology, and key findings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have the following software and libraries installed:

- R programming environment
- Required R packages (e.g., `dplyr`, `rio`, `ggplot2`, `car`, `stargazer`, etc.)

### Installation

1. Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.
2. Install R and the required packages mentioned in the project's R script.

## Data Preprocessing

The project starts with importing the dataset from 'CreditCardTransactions.xlsx' and performing data preprocessing tasks. This includes handling missing values and cleaning the data for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step to understand the data. This project includes various visualizations and statistical analyses to explore spending patterns, relationships between variables, and identify trends within the dataset.

## Modeling

The project uses regression modeling to answer specific business questions related to spending patterns and customer behavior. Two types of models are considered: linear regression and log-linear regression. Model summaries and diagnostics are included in the R script.

## Results

The project's findings and insights are summarized in the R script and accompanying reports. Key results and relationships between variables are highlighted.

## Business Questions

This project answers several business questions, including:

- How do customers' spending patterns vary by spending category, while controlling for other variables?
- What type of customers have the highest and lowest spending by card type? By what amount?
- How do spending patterns vary by wealth tag?
- How do spending patterns vary by revolving indicators?

## Usage

To use this project, follow the installation instructions and run the R script. You can explore the data, models, and visualizations to gain insights into credit card transactions and customer behavior.
